# Bare-Unity-Shooter
A skeleton of an endless, wave-based shooter game created in Unity.  No real assets included other than sound, can be used as a base for either mobile or PC Unity games of this type.

All code is contained in the /Assets/Scripts/ directory, and is organized by script type (player scripts, AI scripts, game-controller scripts).
